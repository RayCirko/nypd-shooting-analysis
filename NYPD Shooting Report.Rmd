### Potential Bias

* Variable Selection Bias: The choice of which variables to include in the analysis can introduce bias by framing the story in a limited way. Key social, economic, or contextual factors may be left outâ€”not because they are unimportant, but because they are not as readily available or measurable. This can lead to incomplete or skewed interpretations of complex issues like public health or law enforcement outcomes.

* Data Collection Bias: The dataset only includes incidents recorded by the NYPD. Unreported or misclassified shootings may not be captured, leading to underrepresentation of certain events or communities.

* Victim Demographic Uncertainty: Some demographic fields, such as victim age and sex, contain "UNKNOWN" or inconsistently entered values. Even after cleaning, this may skew analysis of victim characteristics.
